= RHQ Inventory

:toc:

== Architecture

RHQ.next inventory is going to be a radical departure from the simplistic
"forest" view supported in the RHQ 4.x (forest meaning multiple trees,
where each tree represents an inventory on a single platform).

The first premise then is to allow the inventory to be a directed *cyclic* 
graph. We should not disallow cycles because they can and do happen in the 
real life where "things" are mutually (indirectly) dependent.

A second important premise is that data is fed to RHQ from multiple 
sources, be it the traditional RHQ agent (that will probably at least 
conceptually survive), in-app "feedlets" that send data to RHQ in a very 
simple format similar to that of graphite for example (in fact, we should 
probably support multiple such formats).

These two premises have large consequences that are discussed below.

The reasons for the departure are the following facts that we found during 
the prior versions of RHQ:

* Tree is not enough to capture all the various relationships between 
resources.

* While the agents are necessary for some forms of monitoring/config, they 
also have a number of drawbacks, so they should not be the sole way of 
getting data into RHQ:

** _heavyweight_ - the larger number of things "monitored" by the agent, 
the more resources the agent consumes (and we have a relatively bad track 
record for memory and CPU consumption).

** _poll model_ - polling the managed resources generates load on them 
(but any type of monitoring will create that, of course). Scheduling is 
critical, because it can cause resource consumption spikes both in the 
managed resource and in the agent itself.

** _security_ - in order for the agent to perform management tasks on many 
kinds of resources, it needs quite broad privileges. It is also difficult 
to run processes under specific accounts to limit their privileges.

=== Basic Picture

The basic idea is not that different from the RHQ architecture as it stands 
today.

....

The main differences are:

* Apps can send data directly "out".
* "Out" is not necessarily an RHQ server but merely some kind of endpoint.
* RHQ can consume/receive data from other monitoring/management solutions.

This leaves us with the following questions:

* How to identify the data that come from the applications (we want to 
impose as little as possible on the applications in terms of the format or 
RHQ-specific identification).

* How to identify the agents?

* Do the agents themselves form some kind of hierarchy?

=== Discovery Workflow

We ought to consume management data from other systems like OpenLMI or 
Kubernetes, statsd, etc. Many of these systems do the discovery of their 
own and it would be a waste of resources to not reuse the discovery results 
made by the others.
